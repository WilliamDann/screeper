# TODO List
High:
    ☐ Defense Agent
        ✔ Tower fires on hostile creeps @started(23-02-27 23:22) @done(23-02-27 23:36) @lasted(14m57s)
        ☐ Secure Entrances
        ☐ Defensive Ramparts
        ☐ Spawn defense forces if needed

    ☐ More Strict Agent Scope @started(23-03-02 12:12)
        i.e. A harvest agent explicitly only can act on it's assigned source.
        ☐ Orgainized by room
        ☐ Assigned targets like sources, spawners, extensions, or towers
            ☐ Utilize All Sources @started(23-03-02 12:07)
            This was in med but was moved here as it is part of this higher priority item.
        ☐ Multiple instances of an agent can exist without error
        ☐ Agents can be created and destroyed without error

    ☐ Interchangable Goals
        Right now agents have a stage variable and some code in the tick() func that determines the agent's goals. This could be
        more robust - a Goal object that influinces the agent's actions. 
        ☐ Move context-specific things to a Goal object
            ☐ depo
            ☐ creepTarget
            ☐ bodyTarget
            ☐ stage

Med:
    ☐ Auto Build
        ☐ Extention Hive
        ☐ Roads

    ☐ Resource Agent
        An agent in charge of managing resources like energy. Instead of having to find a container itself, an Agent could ask
        the ResourceAgent where to find what it is looking for.
        ☐ Throws back a WithdrawJob a creep could execute to get the energy it needs
        ☐ Manages resource allocation 
            so as not to promise more energy than it has.
            ☐ Emergency situations
            If a creep needs to be spawned *now* this could need to be overridden.


    ☐ Improved Optimizer
        ☐ Road Lottery
        ☐ Creep Bodies
        ☐ Container far objectives (logistics agent?)
