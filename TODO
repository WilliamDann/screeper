Important:
    ☐ DefenseNode
        Behavior to defend rooms is needed

    ☐ Room Planning
        Building things that go in the room!

        ☐ Extentions
        ☐ Tower
        ☐ Roads (?)
            this could be lower priority

    ☐ Resource Managment
        Right now every Node can request anything it wants to no matter the cost. This _could_ cause a econ crash. 
        It does cause one in the sim room when a creep gets spawned and then dies to the keeper over and over again.

        ☐ Global Requests Object @started(23-03-06 13:40)
            It would be useful to have a standard system Nodes could use to communicate with eachother.

        ☐ Request Spamming
            Is there a way to stop a Node from spamming a request every tick witout baking it into the implementation of the Node?

Useful:
    ☐ Nodes without GameObject producing tag
        It is unclear if a tag that is not an in-game id would cause errors. This would prevent a DefenseNode like a DefenseAgent from the previous iteration.

    ☐ Custom Creep Bodies
        A clear way way for Nodes to know what they can spawn

Possible:
    ☐ Remove Mining
        Looking outside to other rooms and mining their Sources would give more energy.
        There are more important things to worry about at this time.
