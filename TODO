Important:
    ☐ DefenseNode
        Behavior to defend rooms is needed

    ☐ Room Planning
        Building things that go in the room!

        ☐ Extentions
        ☐ Tower
        ☐ Roads (?)
            this could be lower priority

    ☐ Resource Managment
        Right now every Node can request anything it wants to no matter the cost. This _could_ cause a econ crash. 
        It does cause one in the sim room when a creep gets spawned and then dies to the keeper over and over again.

        ☐ Global Requests Object @started(23-03-06 13:40)
            It would be useful to have a standard system Nodes could use to communicate with eachother.

        ☐ Request Spamming @started(23-03-06 16:56)
            Is there a way to stop a Node from spamming a request every tick witout baking it into the implementation of the Node?


        ☐ Idle Location
            Creeps that are idling tend to stand near containers blocking acccess

            grouping around some idle flag would solve this issue. Job system cannot be used because the creep still
            needs to be marked as free.
Useful:
    ☐ Nodes without GameObject producing tag
        It is unclear if a tag that is not an in-game id would cause errors. This would prevent a DefenseNode like a DefenseAgent from the previous iteration.

    ☐ Custom Creep Bodies
        A clear way way for Nodes to know what they can spawn

    ☐ Nodes own Structures
        Nodes own structurs and it's their responsibility to make repair jobs. Right now the room
        make a repair job for all structures that need it.

Possible:
    ☐ Remote Mining
        Looking outside to other rooms and mining their Sources would give more energy.
        There are more important things to worry about at this time.
